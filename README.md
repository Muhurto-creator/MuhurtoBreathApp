# MuhurtoBreathApp

> A digital sanctuary for mindful breathing.

## The Vision

**MuhurtoBreathApp** is more than a utility; it's a quiet space designed to bring a moment of calm and control to a chaotic world. Guided by the core philosophy of "effortless tranquility," every feature—from the fluid animations to the gentle haptic feedback—is crafted to be supportive, not distracting. Our goal is to help users connect with the simple, profound act of breathing.

## Key Features

-   **🌀 Guided Breathing Sessions:** A central, animated circle visually guides you through each phase of a breathing exercise.
-   **🎧 Multi-Sensory Cues:** Follow along with synchronized visual, audio, and haptic feedback for a deeply immersive experience.
-   **⚙️ Deeply Customizable:** Go beyond presets. Manually adjust the timing for your inhale, hold, exhale, and rest periods to create a rhythm that feels perfect for you.
-   **🤖 AI-Powered Coach:** Feeling anxious? Need to focus? Ask our Gemini-powered AI assistant for a personalized breathing pattern recommendation, and apply it with a single tap.
-   **🌓 Minimalist, Calming UI:** A clean, uncluttered interface with Light, Dark, and Auto themes to create a comfortable and focused environment.
